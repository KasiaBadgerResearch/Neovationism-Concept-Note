**Neovationism: The IDEA Framework for Equitable, Innovation-Driven Automation**

Concept Note (Version 1.0)

*By Kasia Badger, 2025*


**Abstract**

Neovationism is a novel economic theory designed to prioritize innovation, equitable growth, and the productive integration of automation across the globe. Traditional economic systems — capitalism, socialism, and hybrids — do not fully incentivize transformative innovation, particularly for individuals without access to substantial resources. Neovationism addresses this gap through the IDEA framework: Incentivize Innovation, Distribute Equitably, Educate for Creativity, and Automate Strategically. Together, these pillars create a system that fosters continuous innovation while ensuring inclusive economic and social outcomes.


**1. Introduction**

Innovation has historically been the primary driver of long-term economic growth. The most prosperous nations are often those that cultivate creativity, technological progress, and knowledge application. Yet structural barriers — limited access to capital, risk aversion, or inequality — often prevent individuals from realizing transformative ideas.

Neovationism positions innovation as the central engine of economic development, while integrating equity, education, and automation to improve human well-being globally.


**2. The IDEA Framework**


**2.1 I = Incentivize Innovation**

- Reward creative problem-solving, experimentation, and intellectual risk-taking.
- Ensure equal opportunity for all individuals to participate in innovation, regardless of socioeconomic background.


**2.2 D = Distribute Equitably**

- Ensure the benefits of innovation and automation are shared broadly.
- Support inclusive growth, social stability, and sustained participation in innovation-driven economies.


**2.3 E = Educate for Creativity**

- Develop human capital to maximize creativity, critical thinking, and innovation potential.
- Align education systems with skills needed for high-intelligence, innovation-focused work.


**2.4 A = Automate Strategically**

- Deploy automation to reduce routine labor, freeing humans for innovation and creative problem-solving.
- Create a self-reinforcing cycle where automation amplifies productivity, enabling further innovation.


**3. Core Principles**

1. Innovation-Centric Policies: Economic incentives prioritize transformative ideas over incremental work.
2. Equitable Growth: The benefits of innovation reach all societal levels.
3. Global Applicability: IDEA principles are scalable across low-, middle-, and high-income countries.
4. Evidence-Driven Implementation: Metrics for innovation, equity, and automation guide policy and governance.


**4. Research and Implementation Strategy**

Neovationism will be empirically validated through a clustered research program:

- Foundational Papers: Define key theoretical aspects of each Neovationism topic.
- Foundational Books: Explain the papers in an accessible narrative form, using only the paper’s content.
- Research Papers: Apply theory empirically across three-country triads (low-, middle-, and high-income) per cluster.
- Research Books: Explain empirical findings derived solely from the corresponding research papers.

This methodology ensures rigorous academic credibility and produces a coherent body of work feeding directly into the Neovationism manifesto.


**5. Global Relevance**

- IDEA principles can be implemented in any economy, adapting to local contexts.
- Combines innovation, automation, equity, and education to create sustainable, future-ready economies.
- Addresses modern challenges: technological disruption, labor transitions, and global sustainability.


**6. Call for Collaboration**

Neovationism invites scholars, policymakers, and innovators to:

- Critically engage with IDEA principles
- Test and refine the framework in diverse contexts
- Collaborate on empirical research to advance theory and practice
